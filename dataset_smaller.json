It will work for larger brush and small trees with multiple swings but I find it easier to use a bow saw for the occasional larger plants I encounter. Note that if you need to cut a lot of larger brush a brush hook would be better than this ditch bank blade as the brush hook blade is thicker and heavier.The tool needs to be sharpened right out of the package to perform best. This removes the paint and any nicks and burrs from the factory grinding as well shipping and handling nicks. I resharpen the blades and spray them with WD-40 after each use so it remains rust free and is ready to go for the next session of cutting brush. Also, I suggest installing either lock washers or nyloc nuts on the bolts to keep them tight in use. Even with that, check them after each use to make sure they are tight--it seems that initially the ash handle compresses a bit and the metal side plates need time to seat fully into the ash.This tool has been a huge improvement over my large lopping shears and machette for clearing brush on a new rail trail.Great tool if used appropriately.
